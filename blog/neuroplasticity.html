<h1>Neuroplasticity</h1>



<p>
    
Neuroplasticity is how your brain learns and grows. Understanding the principles of neuroplasticity has many many benefits. For example, it could help you to learn new skills more efficiently, or could help create new pathways for those experiencing learning disabilities such as; ADHD, Autism and Down Syndrome.
Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your benefit.
In terms of coding there are many different things I could do to start seeing benefits. Breaking everything down into small manageable chunks is incredibly useful while problem solving. Keeping my brain active and continuing to challenge myself with new tasks and problems will not only help increase my neuroplasticity but also develop a vast knowledge of my craft

<h3>Growth Mindset</h3>

<p>
Students with a Growth Mindset look forward to new challenges and positively engage with difficult problems. These students see an opportunity for learning and growth where other students see potential failure and disappointment. This is incredibly relevant to me right now as I am constantly dancing new challenges throughout the DEV course.
In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?
I wouldn’t say the information was too surprising however it is definitely very useful information that is good to keep in my thought my life. 
</p>
<p>
I will face every challenge with a positive mindset. Take every moment as an opportunity to learn and grow. Also I think it’s important to constantly seek new challenges. So far throughout this course I haven’t made the most out of all the stretch material offered. I believe that given time I should seek out these challenges

<h2>My Learning Plan</h2>

<p>I believe that I already use Neuroplasticity and a Growth Mindset while learning even if I wasn’t entirely sure about them although It is really good to understand the importance of these strategies. Now I can make more out of my time and help implement a stronger version of these tactics. The main difference for me being my mindset to new challenges. Most of the time I love a challenge and the satisfaction of figuring stuff out by yourself, but not always. Some days it can feel like shit is just way over my head and I question what I’m doing. Being able to take a step back, focus on what I'm doing, why I'm doing it,  will have a major impact on my time during this course.
