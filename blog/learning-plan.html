        <h3>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>
        <p>My long term goal is to find a job working remotely that gives me the freedom to travel around the world and go on as many adventures as possible. This could be living in Japan for the winters skiing or moving to New York with my partner while she pursues her fashion career. I believe that DEV Academy is the perfect stepping stone in developing the skills required to get such a job!
        </p>

        <h3>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h3>
        <p>I feel that I’ve always been good with logic and problem solving. Concepts in this realm often come intuitive to me and I thoroughly enjoy attacking these kinds of tasks. I feel however, that my creativity isn’t always the best. I can find it challenging at times to get inspiration for these sorts of projects.
        </p>   
        
        <h3>What skills (non-technical/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
        <p>I feel that right now I am quite confident in social/interpersonal skills. This stems from having years worth of experience not only in teaching, but also sales. I would however, really love to build the ability to address large groups through public speaking and presentations.</p>
        
        <h3>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.</h3>
        <p>I really like the idea of the toggl calendar. I will try my best to stick to the recommended time boxes and if there aren't any, I think it's always good to get a little way through something so you can gauge the time frame and workload you're dealing with. Once I have a good idea of that I can plan out my weeks making sure I create a good balance of work and free time. If the work starts packing in and getting way ahead of me, I would go over the timebox plans I had made and do a bit of re-shuffling. I feel that in times of stress like that it's also good to know when you’ve done too much work and need a break. Slamming out an all nighter to be caught up the next day won't always produce the best results…
        </p>

        <h3>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h3>
        <p>When reaching out for help, The discord will come in incredibly useful! I think it's important to first try my best to tackle the problem alone and see how far I can get. After an hour or so (depending on size of workload) reaching out with adequate screenshots and relevant text will go a long way. 
           If I expect help when I ask I should also help others who are reaching out. We’re all a team here after all.
        </p>

        <h3>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h3>
        <p>All I ask for is realistic enough time boxes that will allow me to plan my week out the best I can. And to give me a little help when I get stuck.</p>

        <h2>Boot Camp Plan</h2>

        <h3>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h3>

        <p>My long term goal as of now is still definitely to find a job working remotely that will allow me to travel and make money at the same time.</p>

        <h3>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h3>

        <p>I said before that I’ve always been good with logic and problem solving. Now that we are nearing the end of foundations I feel that this belief has been further solidified. I feel very confident in solving problems and finding solutions (even if they aren’t optimal solutions lol). 
          What I said about creativity also still feels quite true. Css already is quite finicky and having 0 idea what you even what your page to look like doesnt make it any easier haha.
          </p>

        <h3>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h3>

        <p>I believe that my biggest non technical challenge will really be time management. I’ve done good throughout foundations while having the freedom of working in my own time. During boot camp however, I need to step up and make sure Im on top of my time management so that Im not letting other people down</p>

        <h3>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>

        <p>The biggest non technical thing that I would like to take away from boot camp comes back to time management. For the last couple years while I've been traveling and moving around I haven’t really formed a good routine. I would love to create some sort of routine that sets my days up for success.</p>

        <h3>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h3>

        <p>All I expect is for you guys to be fun to hangout with and offer some good help when I need it chur</p>

        <h3>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h3>

        <p>I really expect myself to start a good routine. A routine that makes sure I'm up ready to go at a reasonable hour and makes sure that I’m productive and part of the team throughout the course. Setting up the routine will be easy enough but I need to make sure that I stick to it to the end.</p>
