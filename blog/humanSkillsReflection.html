    <h2> What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the Human Skills learning?</h2>

    <p> Throughout the human skills learning I had to reflect a lot on myself and my own values. I don’t believe I necessarily discovered anything new about myself, but I did get the chance to bring certain values back into focus. The biggest one for me is really my path, i.e. my long term goals, where I'm heading, etc. This course in general has created a new spark and new passion in myself and now I feel confident that I’m doing what’s right for me. I feel that I’m back on that path and taking steps in the direction.</p>
    
    <h2> What are the roles of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h2>

    <p> These are a few different roles for those core concepts. As a developer a lot of time is spent in collaboration. A huge part of your success in a team comes down to how well you understand and manage these concepts. Another huge role these concepts play is in your own mental and physical well being. Throughout this course (and the coding experience in general) there will be many stressful, uneasy times. It is important to be mindful of these concepts to help relieve stress and keep moving forward.</p>

    <h2> What has surprised you the most about the Human Skills learning?</h2>

    <p> The thing that surprised me most honestly how big a role human skills played in the course. - not complaining -  I hadn’t considered how the soft dev lifestyle would affect my daily routine and my own work life balance. I think it’s awesome that you guys focus on teaching the entire process of being a coder not just the coding part.</p>
    
    <h2> What were the most challenging aspects of the Human Skills learning?</h2>

    <p> To be entirely honest. The most challenging part for me had to be writing the actual blog posts. English has never been a strong point of mine hahaha. I end up staring at a blank page with 2 sentences for hours…</p>
    
    <h2> Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on Human Skills learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h2>
    
    <p> believe that human skills are incredibly fundamental in any career path. They are important in not only keeping yourself happy, but also in your ability to work in a team. Software Development is incredibly team focused and can require long working hours. </p>
    
    <h2> Does the time you spent studying Human Skills learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practice programming instead? Justify your answer.</h2>
    
    <p> I feel that the balance between tech and human skills were really good. Human skills never felt like it got in the way of all of the tech challenges and readings. I don’t believe the time was wasted at all as I understand the importance of having a strong sense of human skills, not only in soft dev but in day to day life as well.</p>
