<h2>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h2>

<p>Emotional Intelligence in the ability to take notice of one's emotions and to act on those emotions consciously with intent. 
This could be relating to your own emotions. If you feel angry and upset, its easy to let this get to you and for you to start acting on them unconsciously, lashing out, throwing a tantrum… But understanding the what and the why of your emotions sets you up to make conscious decisions that will improve your mood and how your mood is perceived by other people.
This also relates to your ability to notice other people's emotions. Trying to have an unbiased view of the what and the why, of how they're feeling will not only help to create stronger more meaningful relationships, but also improve your own leadership skills</p>

<h2>How is EQ different to IQ?</h2>

<p>IQ is the intelligence quota. It is a metric determined by someone's ability to do various “intellectual tasks”. These include; problem solving, critical thinking, Mathematical abilities, Spatial perception and Language skills. The metrics are all related to memory and/or your ability to recognize patterns for logical problems.
EQ looks at how you can recognize patterns in EMOTIONAL contexts and how you choose to handle/act on them.</p>

<h2>Why is EQ important?</h2>

<p>Having high emotional intelligence allows you to take control of your emotions. It will create a positive mental outlook on life setting you up for success.

A high emotional intelligence will also help you communicate more effectively with friends, family and coworkers. The thing that sets apart the leaders in the world from the “average” person is their EQ.</p>
